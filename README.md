## Zenith Coin Core Based Ethereum

Official golang implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch.
Binary archives are published at https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the
[Installation Instructions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)
on the wiki.

Building geth requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) and a C compiler.
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make geth

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

    make all


## Running geth

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options)), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Geth instance.

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ geth --fast --cache=512 console
```

This command will:

 * Start geth in fast sync mode (`--fast`), causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding
   processing the entire history of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Bump the memory allowance of the database to 512MB (`--cache=512`), which can help significantly in
   sync times especially for HDD users. This flag is optional and you can set it as high or as low as
   you'd like, though we'd recommend the 512MB - 2GB range.
 * Start up Geth's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Geth's own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Geth instance
   with `geth attach`.

### Full node on the Ethereum test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum contracts, you
almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the
entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the **test**
network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```
$ geth --testnet --fast --cache=512 console
```

The `--fast`, `--cache` flags and `console` subcommand have the exact same meaning as above and they
are equally useful on the testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped to
here.

Specifying the `--testnet` flag however will reconfigure your Geth instance a bit:

 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), Geth will nest
   itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/testnet` on Linux). Note, on OSX
   and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
   endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test network,
   which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.
   
*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Geth will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.*


## Contribution

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions from
anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

If you'd like to contribute to go-ethereum, please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request
for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base. If you wish to submit more
complex changes though, please check up with the core devs first on [our gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum)
to ensure those changes are in line with the general philosophy of the project and/or get some
early feedback which can make both your efforts much lighter as well as our review and merge
procedures quick and simple.

Please make sure your contributions adhere to our coding guidelines:

 * Code must adhere to the official Go [formatting](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting) guidelines (i.e. uses [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/)).
 * Code must be documented adhering to the official Go [commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary) guidelines.
 * Pull requests need to be based on and opened against the `master` branch.
 * Commit messages should be prefixed with the package(s) they modify.
   * E.g. "eth, rpc: make trace configs optional"
